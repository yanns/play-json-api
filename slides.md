When do you need JSON:

consume a REST API
  body of response with WS client
  body of request

  JSON -> model classes
  in scala: JSON -> extract data

produce JSON
  send JSON to other server, with WS client
  send JSON to client (browser, other server)

  model classes -> JSON
  construct JSON directly

transform JSON
  consume a REST API to produce a REST API
